# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/4dmuniz)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

- **Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn

- **Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

- **Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in 56% accuracy .

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Prediction of user interest using bank data](https://github.com/4dmuniz)

<img src="images/bank image.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project you will be provided with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in 87% accuracy using Logistic Regression and SMOTE .

- in this project we are given real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
- The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).
